#Wish I Was Here App

As part of the Team Project module, current students Eiren McLoughlin and Laura Pigott from a the Creative Mulitimedia B.Sc (hons) degree course in Limerick Institute of Technology, Clonmel are designing, creating and building an application title 'Wish I Was Here'. It is the no pay holiday application that transports the user to different locations around the world.

Our aim is to make the world a little bit smaller, one click at a time.

Our project is being developed for android devices and is soon to be widely availble on the Google Play store for download and currently in the Beta stages for selected users during our developement stage.

This application is being developed using Processing 3 and Android Studio. Initially all development was in Processing 3 but now have moved onto Android Studio to allow for things such as Twitter login using Fabric
